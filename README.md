# Rock SendGrid Communication Service

## Intro
This is a communication service for [Rock](http://rockrms.com) that sends and tracks emails using [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/).

If you would like update notifications and one click no-compile updates? You can [buy this plugin from the Rock Store](http://rock.rocksolidchurchdemo.com/package/18).

This plugin is made available on Github to help the little guy churches who don't have either a developer or finance to purchase the plugin. Your contribution on the Rock Store helps fund the Spark Development Network, my progress through university, and my time on Rock core. Purchasing is a win for you, the community, and me.

The repository includes the C# source for use with the [Rockit SDK](http://www.rockrms.com/Rock/Developer).
To download the latest release of the plugin, both the source code and plugin package, click [here](https://github.com/BricksandMortar/SendGrid/releases/latest).
