*Buy me from the Rock Store!*

This plugin is made available on Github to help the little guy churches who don't have either a developer or finance to purchase the plugin. Your contribution on the Rock Store helps fund the Spark Development Network, my progress through university, and my time on Rock core. Purchasing is a win for you, the community, and me.

## Intro
