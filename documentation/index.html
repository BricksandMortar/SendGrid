  <h2 id="sendgrid-setup">SendGrid Account Setup</h3>
  <p>To use this plugin you will need a <a href="https://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid account</a>. SendGrid provide a <a href="https://sendgrid.com/pricing">variety</a> of plans for different volumes of sending. The Lite plan is not supported by this plugin but all other plans are, including the free plan which provides 12,000 free emails per month.</p>
  <p>After creating an account you'll have to wait for your <a href="https://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/200181628">account provisioning</a> to complete before you are able to send email.

      <h4>Credentials</h4>
    <p>To send emails from Rock you'll want to configure a separate credential from the one you use to login to the SendGrid dashboard. To do this, from the SendGrid dashboard, go to <span data-type="action">Settings > API Keys</span> and then create a new API Key. Give it a sensible name (like: Rock Email Send), and tick <code>Restricted Access</code>.

    </p>
    <p>
      Ensure that the API key has full access to Mail Send and then press <span data-type="action">Create and View</span> at the bottom of the page and note down the API key displayed to you. You'll need to enter this into Rock later.

    </p>
      <h4>Analytics</h4>
    <p>{{site.name}} supports email analytics, configuring this is a two step process. First visit <span data-type="action">Settings > Mail Settings</span> on the SendGrid dashboard and switch <span data-type="action">Event Notification</span> on. In the HTTP Post URL box type in your Rock URL followed by <em>/webhooks/SendGrid.ashx</em>. For instance if my Rock site was hosted at https://rock.bricksandmortarstudio.com I'd type in <em>https://rock.bricksandmortarstudio.com/webhooks/SendGrid.ashx</em>. Ensure you select the following actions:
      <ul>
        <li>Opened</li>
        <li>Clicked</li>
        <li>Dropped</li>
        <li>Deferred</li>
        <li>Bounced</li>
      </ul>

    </p>
    <p>If you want to track opens and clicks within your emails you will also need to enable tracking. From the SendGrid dashboard visit <span data-type="action">Settings > Tracking</span> and switch <span data-type="action">Click Tracking</span> and <span data-type="action">Open Tracking</span> on.
      <a href="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/documentation/sendgrid-tracking.png" data-featherlight><img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/documentation/sendgrid-tracking.png" class="img-responsive" id="feather-tracking" alt="SendGrid Tracking Setup" /></a>
    </p>
    <h4>Whitelabels</h4>
    <p>To ensure the best possible delivery you'll need to configure whitelabels (<span data-type="action">Settings > Whitelabels</span>) for the domain(s) you wish to send mail from. This will involve changing DNS records on those domains and so consequently you may need to help of your network administrator. SendGrid make the process very easy and have <a href="https://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/215904137-Whitelabel-Video-Tutorials">a great video</a> to help you get setup.</p>
    <h2 id="rock-sub-section">Rock Configuration</h2>
    <p>Configuring Rock to use SendGrid to deliver your emails is painless. Visit <span data-type="action">Admin Tools > Communications > Communication Transports > SendGrid SMTP</span>. Here you'll find the options for configuring SendGrid. Most of the default options here won't need changing (in fact altering the server from smtp.sendgrid.net is a bad idea!) but you will need to put in values for the username and password. Username is <code>apikey</code> and the password should be the API Key you created on the SendGrid dashboard earlier. After entereing those set the transport to <code>Active</code> and press Save.</p>

        <p>Then you'll need to go to <span data-type="action">Admin Tools > Communications > Communication Mediums > Email</span> and switch the Communication Transport to SendGrid SMTP.</p>
